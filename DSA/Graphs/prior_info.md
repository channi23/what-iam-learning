# Graph Basic

- Graph is something or specifically a diagram which have vertices and edges.
- Walk- A sequence of vertices where each consecutive pair is connected with an edge
- Trail - A walk in which no edge is repeated
- Path - A trail in which no vertex is repeated

- directed and undirected

- cardinality - the number of vertices (vertex  caredinality) , and the number of edges in a graph (edge cardinality) size of the graph is edge cardinality

- vertex degree

- simple graph - a graph with no loops or multiple edges 

- connected graph - there is path between every pair of vertices

- isomorphic graph - two graphs are isomorphic if they have the same structure, even if their vertex names are different.

- complete graph - a complete graph is a graph where every pair of distinct vertices is connected by an edge

- cyclic and acyclic

- DFS edge classification - which has back edge, forward edge , cross edge and tree edges

- strongly connected components (for directed graphs) - if every vertix is reachabel to every other vertex

- Graph representation - Adjecency matrix and Adjaceny list

- Graph Traversals - DFS and BFS
